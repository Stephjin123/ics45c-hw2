// ------------------------- Your tests - student_gtests.cpp ----------------------------- //
// Your own GoogleTest suite for the word_count module. It is graded: the autograder runs it
// against a correct implementation and against several with one bug each. A test is worth
// something only when it passes on the correct implementation and fails on a broken one, so a
// test that always fails (or that tests nothing) earns nothing.
//
// Two examples are given. Add tests of your own for to_lowercase, load_stopwords, count_words
// and output_word_counts, and for the edges: an empty document, a document that is all stop
// words, stop words written in mixed case, and the same word in several cases.
